#  User Story

AS a film fanatic
I WANT to know how recommended a movie is
SO THAT I can decide if it's worth my time to watch it.

WHEN I visit this browser application
I WANT a clean and simple user interface with the option to save my favourites
SO THAT I get search results and can acces them later.

GIVEN that I rely on professional recommendations,
I WANT to see reviews from the New York Times film critics
SO THAT I can find out if a review is a Critic's Pick or not
