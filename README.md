# Group7_Project-1

For group 7's project. We will be designing a website application that will allow users to search for movie reviews from the New York Times and populating film trailers and details. We aim to use 2 API's: The Movie Database (TMDb) API and The New York Times Movie Reviews API. 

We will design a search bar for the user input, a results display section and a dynamic carrousel to show movie icon links.  

Once the search has been made, we want a poster of the title to show, a trailer for the title. We want to be able to display facts about each title such as actors, release dates. The page has a function where the user's recent searches will display below the search field. 

## Features list:

* Responsive website with mobile-first design.
* API calls to New York Times Movie Reviews and The Movide Database
* Dynamic carrousel to show critics' picks 
* Recent searches commited to local storage displayed for quick access
