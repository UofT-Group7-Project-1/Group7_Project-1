# Group7_Project-1

For group 7's project. We will be designing a website application that will allow users to search for movie reviews from the New York Times and populating film trailers and details. We aim to use 2 API's: The Movie Database (TMDb) API and The New York Times Movie Reviews API. 

We will design a search bar for the user input, a results display section and a dynamic carrousel to show movie icon links.  

Once the search has been made, we want a poster of the title to show, a trailer for the title. We want to be able to display facts about each title such as actors, release dates. A function where the user can save it to their liked titles that will display at the bottom of the page with some kind of dynamic interaction.
