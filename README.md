# Group7_Project-1

For group 7's project. We will be designing a website application that will allow users to search for any tv show or movie. We aim to use 3 API's. Netflix, Disney Plus (if available) and Amazon video. 

We will design a search bar for the user input and also a drop down feature with a list of countries. We want the user to be able to provide what country they intend to use the streaming services from. 

Once the search has been made, we want a poster of the title to show, a trailer for the title. We want to be able to display facts about each title such as actors, release dates. A function where the user can save it to their liked titles that will display at the bottom of the page with some kind of dynamic interaction.
