#  User Story

AS a traveler who values entertainment,
I WANT to know in which streaming service my favourite shows and movies are hosted in overseas
SO THAT I can check if I already have a subscription.

WHEN I visit this browser application
I WANT a clean and simple user interface with the option to save my favourites
SO THAT I get search results quickly and can access them later.

AS a film and tv fan,
I WANT content related to my search results to appear on the same result page
SO THAT I can discover new movies/shows to watch during my trip.

GIVEN that I may not know a streaming service that appears in the results
I WANT a link to the services 
SO THAT I can consider subscribing to it before or during my travel.
